    - Save all for later use (may be in different variables with some meaningful data structure) 
    e.g. I saved line 3(heuristics) in a dictionary. You can use anything but I am just giving you an example 
    - Make sure, all of our input data is nicely saved in proper data structure so that we can use it with easy 

# I created a Tree, from the above information, in a dictionary, where keys of the dict were each node and its respective values were connected nodes with its cost. 

  - e.g 
  {1: [[2,4], [5, 10]},  means from node 1 is connected to node 2 and cost is 4, and so on 

# I created a function, which takes a "trace" and returns the cost of the trace
  - e.g. lets say the function is foo(some_hell_path), and if i call foo([1,2,3]), it returns the total cost from 1 to 2 to 3
  - there are smart way to do this, but i used this dumb way 

# Now the main A* Algo Function (there can be 100s of ways), but I though in this way 
  - have one queue -> myOpen 
  - have another queue -> myClosed
  - have some list -> here you will track the expanded nodes 
  - then start iterating from start node till you get the goal node, 
      - nodes which are expanded > push it to myClose
      - nodes which are yet to open > push it to myOpen 

# Now when I look into my own code, i am not able to understand what i did :P So, check this next snap, you may figure it out...although i myself not able to understand what i did :)
